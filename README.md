# Game-Engine

This will be one of our biggest free software: Our own Game Engine!
Currently we are organizing a little team for that but we are on a good way.

## Special

We saw that the engines, that are currently on the market are either slow, badly designed, really expensive, not even accessible for the normal developer or too hard for a small team to use. We want to write a small or medium-sized engine that follows the KISS-principle and so is accessible for every user. It should have an easy GUI (We are currently designing it, but the GUI itself is not even started), of course with a dark-design. The engine will be free and open-source. Even before we get to a state where everything is working, we want to plan how to build the engine so it has a good performance. Once we get it to a working state, we want to focus even more on smaller optimizations.

## KISS-principle

**K** → keep

**I** → it

**S** → simple,

**S** → stupid

That means, that (hopefully) everybody with every knowledge base will be able to use this engine to create his own games in this engine. That is the goal of this project. If you want to read more about the "KISS" principle, [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
